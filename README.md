install mongodb on the same drive as the project
create db with the same name as stated in server.ts
instal front / back separately (`$ yarn` in each directory)
run startall.bat
in case of issues, try running backend (`$ yarn dev`) / frontend (`$ yarn start`) separately
otherwise, contact Rajeeshmanaraveenpurandeep for tech support
